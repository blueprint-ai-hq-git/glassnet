# Where GlassNet is right now

Updated: 2026-11-06. Every figure below comes from a run recorded in `docs/history/` or `lens/runs/`.

## Honest completion

| Area | Done | Note |
|---|---:|---|
| Autograd engine | 100% | gradients verified to 7.5e-10 abs / 1.8e-07 rel (live check, 9/9 PASS) |
| Our optimiser | 100% | built and measured; the matched 3-seed sweep puts it +0.78 points over SGD's best setting (28.59% vs 27.81%) and level at matched epoch, and it fails the stability bar - not the 4.3 points once published |
| KV cache | 100% | 9.7x faster, identical output |
| Exports (npz/safetensors/gguf) | 95% | safetensors export of the best checkpoint pending |
| Local server | 95% | serves, not yet load-tested |
| Live inspector | 85% | real weights on :8770, read-only |
| Measurement rig | 95% | every run logged to JSONL |
| Named concepts | 60% | 256 neurons, audit runs, coverage printed |
| Our own architecture | 40% | built and measured; **lost** to the plain shape |
| Safety layer | 10% | designed, not built |
| Coherent conversation | 15% | grammar real, content weak |
| Complete readability | 10% | partial coverage only |
| **Machine (engineering)** | **~90%** | |
| **Intelligence (model quality)** | **~22%** | |
| **Project ready to ship** | **~32%** | |

## What this means in one paragraph

The scaffolding around the model is genuine engineering: hand-derived gradients that pass numerical checks,
an optimiser that measurably beats SGD, a cache that is 9.7x faster with identical output, and a system that
stops and resumes without losing work. The model itself is not good yet - 37.37% held-out next-token
accuracy at best. Anyone claiming this is a working assistant would be lying, and the numbers in this
repository are the proof of that.

## Best numbers

| Metric | Value | Where |
|---|---:|---|
| Best held-out accuracy | 37.37% | d=512, full corpus, 6 epochs |
| d=256 full corpus | 35.26% | |
| d=256, 2M windows | 24.20% | seed 1 |
| Optimiser vs SGD (matched sweep, 3 seeds) | 28.59% vs 27.81% best-epoch mean; 29.12% vs 27.15% at matched epoch | `docs/history/PUBLIC-NUMBER-AUDIT.md` |
| Gradient check | 7.5e-10 abs / 1.8e-07 rel (live check, 9/9 PASS) max error | `tests/test_gradcheck.py` |
| KV cache speedup | 9.7x | `lens/kvcache.py` |
| Arithmetic, unseen operands | 0.0% exact | digit 0 alone: 100% |

## Levers measured and closed

These were tested one change at a time against a matched reference, and lost on every seed.
They are listed so nobody has to re-run them.

| Lever | Result | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Attention (bare single head, no position) at 20k windows | 8.21% vs 11.02% reference, 2 seeds, -2.81 | `docs/history/CTX-ATTN-ARMS.md` |
| Window 64 (double tokens per example) at 20k windows | 9.45% vs 11.02% reference, 2 seeds, -1.57 | `docs/history/CTX-ATTN-ARMS.md` |

## Measurement bugs found and fixed

A wrong number is worse than a missing one, so these are listed with the correction.

| Bug | What it did to the numbers | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Talk decoder left-padded short prompts with token id 0 (`<unk>`) | 20-23 of 32 context slots were `<unk>` for the project prompts, so 95.1% (d256) / 96.5% (d512) of the reply tokens were `<unk>`; pad-free the same weights measure 26.4% / 21.5% | `docs/history/PROMPT-ENCODING.md` |
