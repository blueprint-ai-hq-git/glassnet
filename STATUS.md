# Where GlassNet is right now

Updated: 2026-11-06. Every figure below comes from a run recorded in `docs/history/` or `lens/runs/`.

## Honest completion

| Area | Done | Note |
|---|---:|---|
| Autograd engine | 100% | gradients verified to 7.5e-10 abs / 1.8e-07 rel (live check, 9/9 PASS) |
| Our optimiser | 100% | built and measured; the matched 3-seed sweep puts it +0.78 points over SGD's best setting (28.59% vs 27.81%) and level at matched epoch, and it fails the stability bar - not the 4.3 points once published |
| KV cache | 100% | 2.29x faster (0.483 -> 0.211 ms/token), identical output |
| Exports (npz/safetensors/gguf) | 95% | safetensors export of the best checkpoint pending |
| Local server | 95% | serves, not yet load-tested |
| Live inspector | 85% | real weights on :8770, read-only |
| Measurement rig | 95% | every run logged to JSONL |
| Named concepts | 60% | 256 neurons, audit runs, coverage printed |
| Our own architecture | 40% | built and measured; **lost** to the plain shape |
| Safety layer | 10% | designed, not built |
| Coherent conversation | 15% | grammar real, content weak |
| Complete readability | 10% | partial coverage only |
| **Machine (engineering)** | **~90%** | |
| **Intelligence (model quality)** | **~22%** | |
| **Project ready to ship** | **~32%** | |

## What this means in one paragraph

The scaffolding around the model is genuine engineering: hand-derived gradients that pass numerical checks,
an optimiser that measurably beats SGD, a cache that is 2.29x faster with identical output, and a system that
stops and resumes without losing work. The model itself is not good yet - 37.37% held-out next-token
accuracy at best. Anyone claiming this is a working assistant would be lying, and the numbers in this
repository are the proof of that.

## Best numbers

| Metric | Value | Where |
|---|---:|---|
| Best held-out accuracy | 37.37% | d=512, full corpus, 6 epochs |
| d=256 full corpus | 35.26% | by position, `lens/runs/ATTN-GRADE-RUN.txt:28` (legacy by-id: 26.31%) |
| d=256, 2M windows | 24.20% | seed 1, by position, `lens/runs/GPU-BEST.txt:64` |
| d=512, 3 epochs, 2M windows (run twice) | 24.39% / 24.40% (ppl 109.90 both) | same script, 0.01 pp spread between two runs a day apart, `docs/history/D512-REPRODUCIBILITY.md` |
| Parameters, shipped d=256 model | 5,908,686 | counted off the model object; `docs/history/PARAM-AUDIT.md`, also `lens/runs/GPU-BEST.txt:57` |
| Optimiser vs SGD (matched sweep, 3 seeds) | 28.59% vs 27.81% best-epoch mean; 29.12% vs 27.15% at matched epoch | `docs/history/PUBLIC-NUMBER-AUDIT.md` |
| Gradient check | 7.5e-10 abs / 1.8e-07 rel (live check, 9/9 PASS) max error | `tests/test_gradcheck.py` |
| KV cache speedup | 2.29x (0.483 -> 0.211 ms/token, 2,069 -> 4,747 tokens/s) | `lens/runs/KV-CACHE-MICRO.txt` |
| Arithmetic, unseen operands | 0.0% exact | digit 0 alone: 100%; two different runs, `lens/runs/ARITHMETIC.txt` and `lens/runs/ARITH_DIAG.txt` |

## Levers measured and closed

These were tested one change at a time against a matched reference, and lost on every seed.
They are listed so nobody has to re-run them.

| Lever | Result | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Attention (bare single head, no position) at 20k windows | 8.21% vs 11.02% reference, 2 seeds, -2.81 | `docs/history/CTX-ATTN-ARMS.md` |
| Window 64 (double tokens per example) at 20k windows | 9.45% vs 11.02% reference, 2 seeds, -1.57 | `docs/history/CTX-ATTN-ARMS.md` |

## Measurement bugs found and fixed

A wrong number is worse than a missing one, so these are listed with the correction.

| Bug | What it did to the numbers | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Talk decoder left-padded short prompts with token id 0 (`<unk>`) | 20-23 of 32 context slots were `<unk>` for the project prompts, so 95.1% (d256) / 96.5% (d512) of the reply tokens were `<unk>`; pad-free the same weights measure 26.4% / 21.5% | `docs/history/PROMPT-ENCODING.md` |
| Architecture table added the proposed recurrent core and counted the tied embedding twice | published "7,081,122 parameters"; the shipped model prints **5,908,686**, so the count was overstated by 1,172,436 (19.8%) | `docs/history/PARAM-AUDIT.md` |
| Cost table added a stage labelled "runs 32x" exactly once | published 0.1446 ms/token; with the core counted the 32 times it runs, the same rows give 0.2283 ms | `docs/history/PARAM-AUDIT.md` |
| KV cache speedup "9.7x" had no run file behind it | only the prose figure existed (0.217 vs 2.115 ms, `docs/history/STATE.md:2730`); the recorded micro-benchmark is **2.29x** (0.483 -> 0.211 ms/token, identical to 5.3e-06) | `lens/runs/KV-CACHE-MICRO.txt` |
| `wall_ab_grade.py` P2 computed `on - off` but graded the pre-registered `off - on` band | the falsifier (`on - off < 0.5`) fired on a real 3.11 pp LOSS and called it "earns under 0.5 pp"; the -1.0..-6.0 band was unreachable, so a perfect result would still have printed "OUTSIDE". Numbers unchanged (-1.39 / -3.11), only the sentence was wrong | `docs/history/GRADER-P2-SIGN.md` |

Verdicts as printed by `lens/scripts/wall_ab_grade.py` (output `lens/runs/WALL-AB-GRADE.txt`,
sha256 ac55e35b..., 6 rows in `lens/runs/WALL-AB-RESULTS.tsv`):

* **P1 FAIL** - `wall_on` s0 10.79% is inside the pre-registered 10.0-12.5 band, s1 9.68% is 0.32 pp
  BELOW the floor. The block did not reproduce the stored rung, so by the rule written before the run
  **no delta against that rung is quoted**. This is the verdict that constrains the other four.
* **P2 OPPOSITE SIGN** - off minus on = +1.39 (s0), +3.11 (s1). Removing the bypass did not cost the
  predicted 1-6 points; on both seeds it was ahead.
* **P3 MIXED** - r64 minus on = +0.49 (s0), +1.19 (s1): not below `on` on either seed, so "rank 64 is
  under-provisioned" is unsupported, but the dose is not clean at seed 1 either.
* **P4 PASS** - mean train-minus-val gap off +8.35 vs on +28.98, i.e. 20.63 pp smaller with 2.1M fewer
  parameters: at this rung the big gap follows capacity.
* **P5 CONTRADICTION CONFIRMED** - the no-bypass arm is above the bypass arm by more than 1.0 pp on both
  seeds, reported as a finding against the plan, not as noise.
* **P6 not triggered** - the resumed arms' recorded command lines match `run_wall_ab.sh` field-for-field
  (only shell quoting of the seed differs), so the resume is valid and its arms are poolable.

What that means: the A/B does **not** establish that the concept wall is lossy, and it does not license
the wider-residual build. It is a coherent lead - same direction on both seeds, 2.1M fewer parameters,
far less overfit - held back by a control arm that missed its band. Deciding between re-running the
control until it lands in 10.0-12.5 and moving to the plan's next lever (data scale) is a human call.
